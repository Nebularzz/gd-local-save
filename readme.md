This is in no way affiliated with RobTopGames. This project is purely to help me and others to save their game data in case it doesn't work in the traditional way.


# GD LOCAL SAVE
I'm making this because I can't save my game data the usual way. So I'm making a tool to automate this.

# INSTALLING
To install, download the zip file from here: https://github.com/Nebularzz/gd-local-save/releases/

# USAGE
To run this, you need to go to the directory where the executable is and run `./gd_local_save arg` replace arg with either `save` or `load`

# DOCUMENTATION
Currently no documentation.

# ERROR REPORTING
If you run into errors, check if you have done everything correctly in here. But if you still get them please tell me about it.

# DEV NOTE
This is very unstable as of now.
